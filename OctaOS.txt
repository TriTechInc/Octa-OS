Hello, My name is Octa...

I'm a voice guided system that does not like to get bullied.
I'm based on kubuntu 15.04
    If not able to detect voice:
I'm sorry, but your microphone is not online.
    Voice detection is online:
Welcome to Octa OS... Please say "Ah" so OOS can idetify the voice.

Thank You, now the system shal do what you say. If you wish to install, please say "OOS Install" If you want the whole HDD, say "Full". If you want a selected partion, say "Part". There is also a non-voice guided system if you want.

WELCOME TO Octa OS...
